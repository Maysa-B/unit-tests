This project consisted of creating several functions to meet the evalueted requirements. Besides, it was neessary create tests, using **Jest**, to verify the operation of other functions.

> It's important to highlight that some documents were provided by Trybe, to help us develop the project. This kind of document has a comment specifying that.
